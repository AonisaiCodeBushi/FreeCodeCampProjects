                        <p class="text-left">
                            The Original Purple Mattress was (and still is) one of our favorite beds on the market.
                            It has an odd feel to it, but definitely in a good way. Unlike most bed in a box mattresses,
                            Purple does not use memory foam, latex foam, or a proprietary foam as its top layer. Instead,
                            Purple uses a gel-like material called Hyper-Elastic Polymer, which is purple in color (hence
                            the name of the bed). This is the star of the show. It’s how the beds stay cool at night and
                            how you don’t end up sweating 5 minutes into your REM sleep. You will see this Hyper-Elastic
                            Polymer on all three new beds from Purple.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-left text-center text-secondary">
                            <strong>Purple 2 vs Purple – Shipping, etc.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            First up, Purple is still offering free shipping and free returns on all of their mattresses.
                            With the OG Purple Mattress, the bed will ship rolled up in a large purple bag. You basically
                            setup the bed like any other bed in a box mattress. With the new Purple beds, they’re too heavy
                            to ship via FedEx, so they come with white glove delivery and free setup.  Additionally, all
                            Purple mattresses come with a 100-night risk-free trial where you can test the bed to see if you
                            absolutely love it. If you don’t, call Purple up and get a full refund (within that trial period).
                            They’ll even send someone to your house to pick up the bed at no extra charge. If you decide to
                            keep the bed, however, it comes with a 10-year warranty.

                        <p class="text-left">
                            The biggest difference between Purple 2 and the OG Purple Mattress is in the construction of
                            the bed. Purple 1 had polyurethane foam and then a 2″ slab of Hyper-Elastic Polymer as the top
                            layer. The Purple 2/3/4 beds swap out the foam for 7.5″ pocketed coils (they still have foam,
                            but only a very small amount). The new Purple beds end up being a few inches thicker than the
                            OG Purple Mattress as a result. Here’s a sideview of the new Purple beds (Purple.4 shown).
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-left text-center text-secondary">
                            <strong>Purple 2 is better suited for heavy individuals</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            Because Purple 2/3/4 incorporate pocketed coils, they will have better support for anyone that’s
                            especially heavy. With the Original Purple Mattress, a larger individual (250LB) would have had
                            issues with support. In addition to adding coils, Purple gives you the option to get a thicker
                            grid of Hyper-Elastic Polymer so that if you’re heavy, you will still experience the benefits
                            of this top layer.
                        <p class="text-left text-center text-secondary">
                            <strong>Purple 2 will have bounce</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            If you’re used to an innerspring mattress and are thinking about Purple, the addition of pocketed
                            coils will give you some of that bounce that you’re already used to. It’s a personal preference
                            thing, but there are definitely some folks that like their mattress to bounce.
                        <p class="text-left text-center text-secondary">
                            <strong>Edge support is better with Purple 2</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            This isn’t something that you think about until you’ve slept on a new bed personally, but edge
                            support is a big issue, especially for couples sleeping on a smaller bed. If you end up sleeping
                            along the edges of the mattress or just competing for space with your partner, you’ll appreciate
                            the extra edge support on the new Purple beds. They’ve added a reinforced border around the mattress
                            to prevent the bed from compressing too much and giving you that “roll off” sensation. Edge support
                            is just okay with the Original Purple Mattress, so it’s nice to see them upgrade the new beds here.

                    <p>
                        If you’re under 250lb and are on a budget, the Original Purple Mattress is the way to go. In fact, unless
                        (1) you’re enamored with having the latest and greatest,
                        (2) you just have to have coils,
                        (3) you are 250lb+, or
                        (4) need to find ways to spend cash, you should probably just look into the Original Purple Mattress.
                        We really liked it two months ago and we still really like it now. Coils are great, but for an average
                        sized person they might not be worth it.  Below are the three main reasons we like the Original Purple!

                            <p>
                                This is less of an issue than you’d expect, given that the new beds have pocketed coils,
                                but it’s still an advantage for the Original Purple. Since it uses foam as opposed to coils,
                                it does a better job of limiting cross-mattress motion.

                                We already discussed this somewhat earlier, but the Original Purple Mattress is lighter and
                                therefore is easier to move. It’s also easier to make since you’re lifting up less weight
                                when you lift up the corners.
