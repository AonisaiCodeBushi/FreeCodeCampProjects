                    <ul class="text-sm-center">
                      <li><strong>1953</strong> - James Horner is born Los Angelos, CA to Jewish Immigrants. Horner started playing piano at the age of five. </li>
                        <li><strong>1960s</strong> - His early years were spent in London, where he attended the Royal College of Music. He returned to America where he attended Verde Valley High School in Sedona, Arizona, and later would receive his bachelor's degree in music from the University of Southern California.</li>
                        <li><strong>1970s</strong> - After he earned a master's degree, he started work on his doctorate at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he studied with Paul Chihara, among others. After several scoring assignments with the American Film Institute in the 1970s, he finished teaching a course in music theory at UCLA and subsequently turned to film scoring.</li>
                        <li><strong>1980s</strong> - Horner's major breakthrough came in 1982, with the music score to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan; the project established him as a mainstream composer. Horner continued composing music for high-profile releases during the 1980s, including 48 Hrs. (1982), Krull (1983), Star Trek III (1984), Commando (1985), Cocoon (1985), Aliens (1986), Willow (1988), Glory and Field of Dreams (both 1989). Aliens earned Horner his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score in 1987, at the 59th Academy Awards.</li>
                        <li><strong>1990s</strong> - Horner produced no fewer than six scores during 1995, including his commercially successful and critically acclaimed works for Braveheart and Apollo 13, both of which earned him Academy Award nominations. Horner's biggest financial and critical success would come with the score to the 1997 film Titanic. The album became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack in history, selling over 27 million copies worldwide.</li>
                        <li><strong>2000s</strong> - Horner recollaborated with James Cameron on the 2009 film Avatar, which was released in December 2009 and has since become the highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing Titanic (also directed by Cameron). His work on Avatar earned him numerous award nominations, including his tenth Academy Award nomination as well as Golden Globe Award, British Academy Film Award, and Grammy Award nominations</li>
                        <li><strong>2010s</strong> - Horner also composed the score for the 2010 version of The Karate Kid, The Amazing Spiderman in 2012, and also Wolf Totem, Southpaw, and The 33 in 2015.</li>
                        <li><strong>2015</strong> - On June 22, 2015, James Horner was piloting his Short Tucano turboprop aircraft when he crashed into the Los Padres National Forest near Ventucopa, California. The following day, his representatives at the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency posted a message on their website stating that Horner, the only person aboard the aircraft, was killed. .</li>
